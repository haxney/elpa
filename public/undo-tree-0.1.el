;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs has a powerful undo-system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in
;; most software, it allows you to recover *any* past state of a buffer
;; (whereas the standard undo/redo system loses past states as soon as you
;; redo). However, this power comes at a price: people can find Emacs' undo
;; confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that replace
;; it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system.
;;
;; Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs'
;; undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of
;; changes. It's not. Undo-tree-mode replaces Emacs' undo system with a system
;; that treats undo history as what it is: a branching tree of changes. This
;; simple idea allows the more intuitive behaviour of the standard undo/redo
;; system to be combined with the power of never losing any history. An added
;; side bonus is that undo history can be stored more efficiently, allowing
;; more changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.
;;
;; The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it
;; was inspired by Vim. But, after all, successful religions always steal the
;; best ideas from other religions.

;; Explanation
;; ===========
;;
;; To understand the different undo systems, it's easiest to consider an
;; example. Imagine you make a few edits in a buffer. As you edit, you
;; accumulate a history of changes, which we might visualize as a string of
;; past buffer states, growing downwards:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;
;;
;; Now imagine that you undo the last two changes. We can visualize this as
;; rewinding the current state back two steps:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;;
;; However, this isn't a good representation of what Emacs' undo system
;; does. Instead, it treats the undos as *new* changes to the buffer, and adds
;; them to the history:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (buffer state before undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (second undo)
;;
;;
;; Actually, since the buffer returns to a previous state after an undo, a
;; better way to visualize it is to imagine the string of changes turning back
;; on itself:
;;
;;        (initial buffer state)  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                  (first edit)  o  x  (second undo)
;;                                |  |
;;                                |  |
;;                 (second edit)  o  o  (first undo)
;;                                | /
;;                                |/
;;                                o  (buffer state before undo)
;;
;; Treating undos as new changes might seem a strange thing to do. But the
;; advantage becomes clear as soon as we imagine what happens when you edit
;; the buffer again. Since you've undone a couple of changes, new edits will
;; branch off from the buffer state that you've rewound to:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (new edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; The standard undo/redo system only lets you go backwards and forwards
;; linearly. So as soon as you make that new edit, it discards the old
;; branch. Emacs' undo just keeps adding changes to the end of the string. So
;; the undo history in the two systems now looks like this:
;;
;;            Undo/Redo:                      Emacs' undo
;;
;;               o     	       	       	       	  o
;;               |	       	       	       	  |
;;               |	      	      		  |
;;               o	      	   		  o  o
;;               .\                               |  |\
;;               . \                              |  | \
;;               .  x  (new edit)                 o  o	|
;;   (discarded  .                                | /   |
;;     branch)   .                                |/    |
;;               .                                o     |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      x  (new edit)
;;
;; Now, what if you change your mind about those undos, and decide you did
;; like those other changes you'd made after all? With the standard undo/redo
;; system, you're dead. There's no way to recover them, because that branch
;; was discarded when you made the new edit.
;;
;; However, in Emacs' undo system, those old buffer states are still there in
;; the undo history. You just have to rewind back through the new edit, and
;; back through the changes made by the undos, until you reach them. Of
;; course, since Emacs treats undos (even undos of undos!) as new changes,
;; you're really weaving backwards and forwards through the history, adding
;; new changes to the end of the string as you go:
;;
;;				  o
;;     	       	       	       	  |
;;                                |
;;                                o  o	   o  (undo new edit)
;;                                |  |\	   |\
;;                                |  | \   | \
;;                                o  o  |  |  o	 (undo the undo)
;;                                | /   |  |  |
;;                                |/    |  |  |
;;               (trying to get   o     |  |  x	 (undo the undo)
;;                to this state)        | /
;;                                      |/
;;                                      o
;;
;; So far, this is still reasonably intuitive to use. It doesn't behave so
;; differently to standard undo/redo, except that by going back far enough you
;; can access changes that would be lost in standard undo/redo.
;;
;; However, imagine that after undoing as just described, you decide you
;; actually want to rewind right back to the initial state. If you're lucky,
;; and haven't invoked any command since the last undo, you can just keep on
;; undoing until you get back to the start:
;;
;;               (trying to get   o		 x  (got there!)
;;     	       	  to this state)  |		 |
;;                                |		 |
;;                                o  o	   o  	 o  (keep undoing)
;;                                |  |\	   |\	 |
;;                                |  | \   | \	 |
;;                                o  o  |  |  o	 o  (keep undoing)
;;                                | /   |  |  |	/
;;                                |/    |  |  |/
;;               (already undid   o     |  |  o  (got this far)
;;                to this state)        | /
;;                                      |/
;;                                      o
;;
;; But if you're unlucky, you've moved the point (say) after getting to the
;; point labelled "got this far". In that case, you've "broken the undo
;; chain". If you try to undo now, Emacs thinks you're trying to undo the
;; undos. So to get back to the initial state you now have to rewind through
;; *all* the changes, including the undos you just did:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o                          x  (finally got there!)
;;       to this state)  |                          |
;;                       |                          |
;;                       o  o     o     o     o     o
;;                       |  |\    |\    |\    |\    |
;;                       |  | \   | \	| \   | \   |
;;                       o  o  |  |  o	o  o  |  o  o
;;                       | /   |  |  | /   |  |  | /
;;                       |/    |  |  |/    |  |  |/
;;      (already undid   o     |  |  o<.   |  |  o
;;       to this state)        | /     :   | /
;;                             |/      :   |/
;;                             o       :   o
;;                                     :
;;                             (got this far, but
;;                              broke undo chain)
;;
;; Confused?
;;
;; In practice you can just hold down the undo key until you reach the buffer
;; state that you want. But whatever you do, don't move around in the buffer
;; to check! Because you'll break the undo chain, and then you'll have to
;; traverse the entire string of undos again to get back to the point at which
;; you broke the chain. Commands such as `undo-only', and undo in region (in
;; transient-mark-mode), help make using Emacs' undo a little easier, but
;; nonetheless it remains confusing.
;;
;;
;; So what does undo-tree mode do? Remember the diagram we drew to represent
;; the history we've been discussing (make a few edits, undo a couple of
;; times, and edit again)? The diagram that conceptually represented our undo
;; history, before we started discussing specific undo systems? It looked like
;; this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (current state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; Well, that's *exactly* what the undo history looks like to undo-tree-mode.
;; It doesn't discard the old branch (as standard undo/redo does), nor does it
;; treat undos as new changes to be added to the end of a linear string of
;; buffer states (as Emacs' undo does). It just keeps track of the tree of
;; branching changes that make up the entire undo history.
;;
;; If you undo from this point, you'll rewind back up the tree to the previous
;; state:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (undo)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; If you were to undo again, you'd rewind back to the initial state. If on
;; the other hand you redo the change, you'll end up back at the bottom of the
;; most recent branch:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (redo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; So far, this is just like the standard undo/redo system. But what if you
;; want to return to a buffer state located on a previous branch of the
;; history? Since undo-tree-mode keeps the entire history, you simply need to
;; tell it to switch to a different branch, and then redo the changes you
;; want:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |

;; Trying to imagine what Emacs' undo is doing as you move about such a tree
;; will likely frazzle your brain circuits! But in undo-tree-mode, you're just
;; moving up and down this undo history tree. Most of the time, you'll
;; probably only need to stay on the most recent branch, in which case it
;; behaves like standard undo/redo, so is just as simple to understand. But if
;; you ever need to recover a buffer state on a different branch, the
;; possibility of switching between branches and accessing the full undo
;; history is still there.
;;
;;
;; Actually, it gets better. You don't have to imagine all these diagrams,
;; because undo-tree-mode includes an undo-tree visualizer which draws them
;; for you. In fact, it draws even better diagrams: it highlights the node
;; representing the current buffer state, and it also highlights the current
;; branch. (There's one other tiny difference: the visualizer puts the most
;; recent branch on the left rather than the right, because it's slightly more
;; convenient for really big trees.)
